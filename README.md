## More Describtion about this project:

- I created a straightforward clothing e-shop using HTML and CSS/SCSS. The website is fully responsive and comprises four sections: a navbar, a main part (hero section), a newsletter section, and a footer. I utilized both flex and grid features to ensure a cohesive arrangement of various divisions.
